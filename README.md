# feather-classifier
This demo originates from my group's deep learning project titled "<b>Fine-grained Classification of Bird Species</b>" which won the Intuitive Surgical Best Project Award. We investigated the utility of both orderful and orderless second-order information for fine-grained image classification tasks. To this end we compared the performance of self-attention mechanisms and bilinear convolutional networks. Finally, we proposed a novel architecture which aimed to leverage the dataset's hierarchical labeling to increase predictive context. The project was implmented with PyTorch.

The feather image dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/feathers-dataset/feathersv1-dataset)
In this repository is a brief 2-page paper summarizing our results. The paper also includes out citations.
